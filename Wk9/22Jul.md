## Software Development Life Cycle
Programs are distinct from software in that they have less documentation, are more ad hoc, and are usually created by individuals rather than teams.  

Software can be customised, generic (aka COTS (commerical off-the-shelf)) or embedded.  

In order to write software, one must first understand the requirements. There are three stages for this:

* gathering or elicitation: finding out what each stakeholder expects from the software
* analysis: understanding how to make code viable under the expectations
* specification: documenting and publishing the requirements (SRS)

A piece of software is often made of distinct modules, which are created separately and then integrated.

## Modules
Python has a set of standard libraries, which implement several useful functions. A library's functions can be used in code by importing it. For example, we can use the `random` library to generate 10 random integers between 1 and 10 (inclusive):
    
    import random
    for i in range(10):
        print(random.randint(1,10))

The `.` indicates that the `randint` function is part of the `random` library.

On the other hand, if we simply import the functions from the library, we needn't use this syntax. For instance
    
    from random import randint
    for i in range(10):
        print(randint(1,10))

## Lists, Tuples, Sets and Dictionaries
### Lists
Lists are denoted in square brackets with comma-separated values, as in
    
    marks = [77,88,90,100]

They can be indexed into using square brackets; thus `mark[0]` returns 77. We can also use negative indexing to index from the end: `mark[-2]` returns 90.

Lists can be sliced with colon notation; for example, `marks[1:-1]` returns `[88,90]`. Note that the last index is excluded.

Lists are mutable; thus their indices can act as lvalues as well. The following statement:

    marks[0] = 71

does not throw an error.

A entry of a list can be deleted as well; for instance, `del marks[0]` causes `marks` to be `[88,90,100]`.

One can also assign each element of a list to a variable:
    
    marks1, marks2, marks3 = marks

Now `marks1` has 88, `marks2` 90 and `marks3` 100.

We can find the index of a certain value using the `index` method: `marks.index(100)` returns 2.

Lists can be appended to using the `append` method: `marks.append(97)` causes `marks` to be `[88,90,100,97]`.

One can insert at any index using the `insert` method. `marks.insert(0,85)` causes marks to be `[85,88,90,100,97]`.

Entries can be removed by value; `marks.remove(100)` causes `marks` to be `[85,88,90,97]`. It deletes the first occurrence of the value).

Lists can be sorted using the `sort` method, in either ascending or descending order: `marks.sort()` does not change `marks`; `marks.sort(reverse=True)` reverses it.

Note that variables that rely on list values store references to the values; thus when they are changed, the list is changed too and vice versa.

### Tuples
Tuples are distinct from lists in that they are immutable. They are denoted by round brackets and comma-separated values.
    
    t_marks = (77,80,90,95)

Being immutable, tuple values are not references, but actual values (unlike lists).

A singleton tuple must have a comma to distinguish it from a simple value; thus `(100,)` is a tuple but `(100)` is not.

### Sets
Sets are enclosed in curly brackets and have comma-separated values. They are not allowed to have duplicates and the order of the values is not defined.

    s_makrs = {77,77,88,90}

Now, `s_marks` may contain `{77,88,90}`.

Sets are mutable.

### Dictionaries
Dictionaries are a mutable data type that stores a relation between keys and values. Their syntax is similar to sets:
    
    mydict = {'name': 'Bani','age': 19}

Dictionaries are also unordered.
Now the keys behave exactly like list indices; therefore `mydict['name']` returns `'Bani'`.

To iterate over key-value pairs, one must use the `items` method:
    
    for key,val in mydict.items():
        print(key,val)

Similarly, one can iterate over only keys using the `keys` method and over only the values using the `values` method.

The `get` method allows us to supply a default return value for when the key does not exist; thus `mydict.get('name',0)` returns `'Bani'`, but `mydict.get('house',0)` returns 0.

Similarly, `setdefault` allows us to set a key's value if they key does not already exist.

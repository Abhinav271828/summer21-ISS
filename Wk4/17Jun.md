## Conditional Expressions
The syntax of the switch statement is as follows:
    
    switch(expr)
    {
    case x:
        //code
        break;
    case y:
        //code
        break;
    default:
        //code
    }

## Functions
Functions are defined using the `function` keyword:
    
    function showMessage()
    {
        let message = "Hello!" //local variable
        alert(message)
    }

There is a special function `this` which holds the current environment.  

Variable's type can be changed using the functions `Boolean()`, 

## Loops
Loops can be while loops
    
    while (expr)
    {
        //code
    }

do while loops,
    
    do
    {
        //code
    } while (expr)
 
 or for loops
    
    for (init; cond; incr)
    {
        //code
    }

## OOPS
Classes are defined similar to C++; they have constructors and other methods.

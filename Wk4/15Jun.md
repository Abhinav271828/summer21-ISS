Taught by Sai Anirudh Karri

## JavaScript
JavaScript is a client-end scripting language. It enables websites to have dynamic components. It is included in HTML files using the `<script>` tag if it is written externally.  
    
    <html>
    <body>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        document.write("Helloworld")
    </script>
    </body>
    </html>
    
## Variables and Operators
Variable names are case sensitive and must begin with a letter or an underscore.  

The usual arithmetic operators `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `++` and `--` are available, as well as the shorthand and normal assignment operators.  
The logical operators `&&`, `||` and `!` can be used.

Input can be taken as
    
    <script>
        x=prompt("What is it?")
        document.write("It is " + x)
    </script>
